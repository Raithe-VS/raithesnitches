  "snitchesguide-text": "The **Snitch** is a mystical scrying device used to detect and record the actions of nearby Seraphs. It is ideal for guarding storage areas, entrances, and territory boundaries.\n\n**Building a Snitch**\nTo craft a Snitch, you will need:\n- 1 Temporal Gear\n- 1 Dense Metal (either Lead or Molybdochalkus)\n- Glass\n- Tool-grade Metals\n\nOnce constructed, place the Snitch block in your desired location and activate it to begin monitoring.\n\n**How Detection Works**\nOnce active, the Snitch will watch the surrounding area for player activity, including:\n- Trespassing\n- Block Interactions\n- Item Theft\n\nIf server admins have enabled sneaking mechanics, the Snitch will have two detection zones:\n- **Truesight Radius**: Any Seraph inside this radius will always be detected, regardless of sneaking.\n- **Standard Radius**: Seraphs sneaking within this area will not be detected.\n\n**Retrieving Violation Logs**\nTo extract logs from your Snitch, you'll need:\n- A writing medium (either paper or a book) in your right hand\n- A writing tool (currently only ink and quill) in your left hand\n\nHold both, then Ctrl + Right Click on the Snitch for a set amount of time (configured by the server). When the process completes:\n- A number of logs will be written into the medium\n- Those logs will be cleared from the Snitch\n\nThe resulting book or paper will be signed by the Snitch, including its block position, and will become immutable.\n\n⚠️ Important: You may overwrite previously signed books with new logs from your Snitch. Be cautious not to destroy important records."
