By default, it can record:<br>- Trespassing (entering its range)<br>- Escaping (leaving while tracked)<br><br>- Using blocks (e.g., opening chests)<br>- Placing blocks<br>- Breaking blocks<br><br>- Breaking a reinforced block<br>- Placing a reinforcement<br><br> Hitting entities<br>- Killing entities<br>- Spawning nearby<br><br>- Taking items from containers<br><br>If the server has sneaking mechanics enabled, detection is split into two zones:<br>- <strong>Truesight Radius</strong> – Seraphs are always detected, even while sneaking<br>- <strong>Standard Radius</strong> – Seraphs can evade detection if sneaking<br><br><strong>Selecting Which Violations to Track</strong><br>Snitches can be customized to track only the violation types you care about.<br><br>To configure this:<br>1. <strong>Sneak and Right Click</strong> your Snitch to open the configuration GUI<br>2.

Do not reuse signed books unless you're sure the previous records are no longer needed."
